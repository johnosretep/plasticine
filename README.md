#### ONLY FOR TERMINAL USERS!

### Among the hundreds of themes for vim, I did not find one that I like. Perhaps I will make one more.
Plasticine because the code is like plasticine, an infinitely pliable shape.
I was inspired by Nord's theme (https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim), but I prefer the color of sea foam more.

With AirLine

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Via plugin/runtimepath manager
I recommend to use [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).  
Add Plasticine Vim to your `.vimrc`
```vim
Plug 'prognostic/plasticine'
```
and install via `:PlugInstall`.
